This folder contains two example scripts, and two datasets. 

The script plot_digitise_FTAN.py is a python code to generate and digitise FTAN maps.
The script run_FTAN.py inverts the digitised inversion curves. 

The datafile example_trace.sac is a seismic trace in SAC format that can be read  by obspy. 
It is used by both scripts. 
The file example_trace.sac.disp is an inversion curve digitised by the script plot_digitise_FTAN.py, and can be used to replicate examples in the accompnaying paper. 

See the Documentation directory for ipython notebooks/pdfs explaining these examples.
